	It's an experiment, place a not so subliminal, slightly
cagey message in front of a viewer and see how long it takes to create a response, and what was the response...
	It was the same thing with the "Blow me" message, only it had a
quicker response time...and some unexpected responses along with the
expectedly negative ones...
	Anyone see how long that took?
		Yours, in jest...
