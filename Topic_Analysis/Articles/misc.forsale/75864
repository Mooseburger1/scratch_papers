Heise model 710A pressure meter. This is a precision 4-1/2
digit meter measuring 0 - 15 PSI (absolute) in .001 psi
increments.  Case is in extremely good shape, and can be used
as a stand-alone meter or panel mounted. Brass fitting (looks
like standard 3/8") on back. Operates from 110 VAC.

I'd like $50 for it, or make an offer. It is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer, which is what I've been using
it for.
