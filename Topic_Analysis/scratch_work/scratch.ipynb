    "    A $1^{st}$-Order Tensor is either a row or column vector. We often see it denoted as having shape of either $\\mathbb{R}^{Mx1}$ or $\\mathbb{R}^{1xN}$. Here, M dictates the number of rows (elements) in the column vector. N dictates the number of columns (elements) in the row vector. $\\mathbb{R}$ represents the overall state of the $1^{st}$-Order tensor. It means that the tensor is constructed of all real values and is in the shape of {M x 1} or {1 x N}.\n",

    "That derivative shouldn't look right to you. We want to take the derivative of the objective function, but there are two unknowns, H and W. We have two unknowns and one equation. We are faced with an underdetermined system. A ubiqutious way to solve this least squares problem is by employing a method called alternating least squares. Since we have two unknowns, we first fix one of the unkonwns and model it as a constant. We then take the derivative of the objective function with respect to the non fixed variable, set it euqal to 0 and solve. We then hold that variable fixed and take the derivative of the fucntion with respect to the previously held fixed variable. We alternate back and forth until we converge to a solution. Hence **Alternating Least Squares** or **ALS**\n",
